# Sign Language Classification

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to perform classification of sign language gestures using CNN.

The project consists of four parts:
* **01 - Data Analysis**: We portray a number of random instances from the dataset, inspect its shape, the number of classes, and check how balanced the dataset is.
* **02 - Model 1**: We show the entire process of constructing, training, and evaluating the most basic model for the problem.
* **03 - Model 2**: We enhance the previous model for better performance.
* **04 - Comparison**: We compare the previous models to gain insights into their performance.

## Dataset
The dataset and its description can be found at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ardamavi/27-class-sign-language-dataset).
